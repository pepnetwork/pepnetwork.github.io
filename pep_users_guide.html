	<h3>Program Description</h3>
	This on line resource is divided into 12 individual modules, which together
	concisely and in detail cover the 3 key areas of pediatrics most relevant and
	concerning to us as EM-trained physicians practicing emergency pediatrics in the
	community hospital and non-pediatric emergency department setting:
	<br><br>
	<b><ol>
		<li>Diagnosis and management of the very sick child.</li>
		<li>Management of the most common pediatric emergencies.</li>
		<li>Early recognition and diagnosis of the child who appears well, but is really very sick.</li>
	</ol></b>
	<br>	
	Together, these 12 modules comprise the core pediatric that emergency physicians need to maintain for successful practice of emergency pediatrics.

	<h3>How to Make Best Use of The Modules</h3>
	<br>
	<h2>Building Your Knowledge Base To Last</h2>
	Each module builds sequentially on the information contained in the prior
	module. Therefore, for successful use, you must first master the material in each
	module, before proceeding to the next.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Organization of Material</h2>
	For each module, begin by viewing the audiovisual presentation, followed by
	reviewing the on-line syllabus. The syllabus will provide you with a concise
	summary of the information detailed in the audiovisual presentation.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Complete ALL Components of Each Module</h2>
	<p>For each module there is essential information contained in the Audiovisual Presentation which is not repeated in the On-Line Syllabus. Besides explaining the rationale and making sense out of the syllabus so you aren't just blindly having to memorize lists of information, each Audiovisual also presents real case scenarios and shows you how to apply the PEP protocols and evidence-based guidelines contained in the syllabus. The Audiovisuals are also peppered with many clinical tips and 'pearls' from our Pediatric Emergency Medicine colleagues which you'll find useful for your own practice. We highly recommend carefully viewing each Audiovisual Presentation in its entirety, once or more, before proceeding to the on-line syllabus review of the material. Each syllabus provides a concise review of the material which can be easily referenced again before or during a shift. Finally, the quizzes we have provided at the end of each module are not only for self-assessment; rather, once again additional/new clinical teaching points are brought out from taking the quizzes. These additional teaching points are elaborated on in the quiz answers.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
	Following review of the material, self-assessment by taking the on-line quiz for that module, is
	highly recommended. Your score, as well as the correct answers, will be provided
	as soon as you submit the quiz. You will also have the option to re-set the quiz,
	to clear your original answers so you can re-take the quiz again (if you wish to do
	so). This option can be useful for seeing if you can improve your score. For each
	module, we recommend re-taking the quiz to achieve a score
	of &#8805; 90% before proceeding to the next module.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Knowledge Retention</h2>
	The re-set option described above for each quiz, as well as additional (optional) quizzes, will be
	made available to you should you wish to retest yourself on any topic later on.
	Since as emergency physicians working in the community hospital ED setting we see smaller numbers of children as compared to adults,
	this is a good way to reinforce and sharpen the core pediatric knowledge you
	need and ensure that you’ll always have it ready for use in your practice.
